# Legatum Prosperity Index

I created a visual on the Legatum Prosperity Index, which forms a part of the A3 assessment. 
The data talks about the prosperity of a country ranked and evaluated through various factors such as GDP, education, environment etc. The DV created is the top 20 countries with the highest ranks.
